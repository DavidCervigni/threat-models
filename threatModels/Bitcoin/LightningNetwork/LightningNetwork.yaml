  description: |
    This document extends the Bitcoin threat model to focus on the Lightning Network, addressing threats to payment channels, routing nodes, and channel state integrity. The Lightning Network improves Bitcoin's scalability by facilitating off-chain transactions, but introduces specific security challenges. Transaction examples are derived from the Lightning Network whitepaper, incorporating the role of watchtowers to mitigate specific threats.

  - ID: CHANNEL_STATE_TAMPERING
    title: Tampering with Channel States
    threatType: Tampering
    impactDesc: |
      Attackers tamper with channel states, leading to disputes or financial loss for participants.
    attack: |
      A malicious channel partner broadcasts an outdated channel state to reclaim funds already spent. For example, Alice and Bob open a channel with 1 BTC each. Alice pays Bob 0.5 BTC off-chain, but later broadcasts the original channel state to reclaim her initial 1 BTC.

        description: |
          Use penalty transactions to ensure that any attempt to broadcast an outdated state results in a financial penalty for the attacker. Watchtowers monitor the blockchain for outdated states and broadcast penalty transactions on behalf of the victim.

  - ID: ROUTING_NODE_DOS
    title: Denial of Service on Routing Nodes
    threatType: Denial of Service
    impactDesc: |
      Attackers overwhelm routing nodes, disrupting payment processing and reducing network availability.
    attack: |
      A network adversary floods routing nodes with fake or excessive requests, causing them to exhaust resources. For instance, an attacker could repeatedly attempt to route payments through a specific node, forcing it to handle an unsustainable load.

  - ID: CHANNEL_CLOSURE_DELAY
    title: Delayed Channel Closure
    threatType: Elevation of Privilege
    impactDesc: |
      A malicious channel partner delays the closure of a channel, locking funds and causing financial loss.
    attack: |
      The attacker refuses to cooperate during the channel closure process or uses the dispute mechanism maliciously. For example, Bob delays closing a channel with Alice, preventing her from accessing her locked funds during a time-sensitive event.

    title: Privacy Leak in Payment Routing
    threatType: Information Disclosure
    impactDesc: |
      Sensitive transaction details are exposed to unauthorized entities, compromising user privacy.
    attack: |
      Malicious routing nodes or external adversaries analyze payment routes to infer transaction amounts and participants. For example, a routing node could monitor the flow of payments to deduce Alice is paying Charlie 0.2 BTC via Bob.

    title: Watchtower Unavailability
    threatType: Denial of Service
    impactDesc: |
      Unavailable watchtowers fail to detect and penalize malicious behavior, weakening channel security.
    attack: |
      A network adversary targets watchtowers with a DoS attack, preventing them from monitoring channel state broadcasts. For example, an attacker floods a watchtower with traffic to render it non-functional during a critical dispute.
