threats:
  - ID: 51_PERCENT_ATTACK
    title: Control of Majority Hashing Power
    threatType: Elevation of Privilege
    impactDesc: |
      Allows an attacker to rewrite transaction history, double-spend, or block transactions.
    attack: |
      An attacker accumulates more than 50% of the total mining power and uses this control to create a longer blockchain fork, thereby rewriting transaction history or blocking new transactions.

  - ID: DOUBLE_SPENDING
    title: Double Spending
    threatType: Tampering
    impactDesc: |
      Compromise of transaction validity by spending the same Bitcoin multiple times.
    attack: |
      The attacker broadcasts two conflicting transactions to the network, one to make a purchase and another to send the same funds back to their own wallet, exploiting timing and confirmation delays.

  - ID: NETWORK_PARTITION
    title: Network Partitioning (Eclipse Attack)
    threatType: Denial of Service
    impactDesc: |
      Isolate nodes from the main network, manipulating their view of the blockchain.
    attack: |
      By controlling a nodeâ€™s peers, the attacker isolates the target node from the rest of the network, feeding it incorrect blockchain data or preventing it from receiving updates.

  - ID: MINING_REORG
    title: Blockchain Reorganizations
    threatType: Information Disclosure
    impactDesc: |
      Reverse transactions by introducing a longer fork.
    attack: |
      Malicious miners use their hashing power to create an alternate chain that invalidates recent blocks, causing a reorganization of the blockchain.

  - ID: HASH_POWER_DECREASE
    title: Loss of Hash Power Due to Incentives
    threatType: Economic Threat
    impactDesc: |
      A significant decrease in hash power can lead to a drop in Bitcoin's price, reducing miner incentives, and potentially causing a negative feedback loop of further decreases in hash power before the next difficulty adjustment occurs. This creates a risk to the stability and security of the network, potentially making it more susceptible to attacks.
    attack: |
      If the prevailing market conditions lead to low Bitcoin prices, miners may exit the market as profitability decreases. This reduction in mining activity could create a downward spiral where the network becomes less secure due to lower hash power, leading to longer confirmation times and increased vulnerability to attacks.
