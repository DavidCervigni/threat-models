threats:
  - ID: 51_PERCENT_ATTACK
    title: Control of Majority Hashing Power
    threatType: Elevation of Privilege
    impactDesc: |
      Allows an attacker to rewrite transaction history, double-spend, or block transactions.
    attack: |
      An attacker accumulates more than 50% of the total mining power and uses this control to create a longer blockchain fork, thereby rewriting transaction history or blocking new transactions.

      - ID: DIVERSE_HASHPOWER
        title: Encourage diverse miner participation
        description: |
          Promote geographic and organizational decentralization of miners to reduce the likelihood of any single entity achieving majority hash power.

  - ID: DOUBLE_SPENDING
    title: Double Spending
    threatType: Tampering
    impactDesc: |
      Compromise of transaction validity by spending the same Bitcoin multiple times.
    attack: |
      The attacker broadcasts two conflicting transactions to the network, one to make a purchase and another to send the same funds back to their own wallet, exploiting timing and confirmation delays.

  - ID: NETWORK_PARTITION
    title: Network Partitioning (Eclipse Attack)
    threatType: Denial of Service
    impactDesc: |
      Isolate nodes from the main network, manipulating their view of the blockchain.
    attack: |
      By controlling a nodeâ€™s peers, the attacker isolates the target node from the rest of the network, feeding it incorrect blockchain data or preventing it from receiving updates.

    threatType: Information Disclosure
    impactDesc: |
      Reverse transactions by introducing a longer fork.
    attack: |
      Malicious miners use their hashing power to create an alternate chain that invalidates recent blocks, causing a reorganization of the blockchain.
