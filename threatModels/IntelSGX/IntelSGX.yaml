    threatType: Information Disclosure
    impactDesc: |
      Leakage of sensitive information through side-channel analysis, such as cache timing or power consumption.
    attack: |
      Attackers monitor cache timing, memory access patterns, or power consumption during enclave execution to infer sensitive information, such as cryptographic keys.
