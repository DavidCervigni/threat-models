You are absolutely correct. Storing some verifiable off-chain full data fundamentally **changes the threat model** of a blockchain. This is a critical point in understanding the trade-offs involved in scaling solutions and data availability designs.

Here's why and how the threat model shifts:

**Traditional Blockchain Threat Model (On-Chain Everything):**

In a purely on-chain model (like early Bitcoin or simpler smart contract platforms where all data and computation are on-chain):

*   **Threats:**
    *   **Data Censorship:** An attacker might try to prevent specific transactions from being included in blocks.
    *   **State Tampering:** An attacker might try to alter account states directly, though this is extremely difficult due to cryptographic linking and consensus.
    *   **Computational Limits:** The limited computational power of smart contracts restricts the complexity of operations.
    *   **High Transaction Fees:** Storing all data on-chain is expensive, leading to high fees for users.
    *   **Scalability Bottlenecks:** The network can only process so many transactions per second because all data must be validated by all nodes.

*   **Trust Assumptions:** Minimal trust is required. The integrity of the system relies on the public ledger and the decentralized consensus mechanism. If you can access the ledger, you can verify everything.

**Blockchain Threat Model with Verifiable Off-Chain Data:**

When some "full data" is stored off-chain but is made verifiable (often through ZK proofs, Merkle roots, or other cryptographic commitments), the threat model introduces new considerations:

*   **New Threats:**
    1.  **Data Availability Risk:** This is the most significant shift. If the off-chain data is essential for verifying state transitions or reconstructing the blockchain's history, and that off-chain data becomes unavailable (e.g., the data provider goes offline, is attacked, or maliciously withholds it), the on-chain system might break down.
        *   **Example:** In a ZK-rollup, if the operator fails to publish the compressed transaction data (even if the ZK proof is valid), users might not be able to exit the rollup or reconstruct its state if the operator disappears.
    2.  **Centralization Risks of Data Storage:** The off-chain data storage might be managed by a single entity or a small group of entities. This introduces centralization risks:
        *   **Censorship by Data Provider:** The entity storing the off-chain data could refuse to serve it to certain users or for certain transactions.
        *   **Data Manipulation (by the provider):** While ZK proofs can verify the *computations* on the data, they don't inherently guarantee the *availability* or *integrity* of the data itself if the provider is malicious and the data is not sufficiently replicated or retrievable.
        *   **Single Point of Failure:** If the off-chain storage solution fails, the entire system relying on it could be compromised.
    3.  **Complexity of Verifiability:** The mechanism that makes off-chain data "verifiable" (e.g., ZK proofs, data availability committees) introduces its own set of complexities and potential attack vectors if not implemented correctly. The security of the ZK proof system itself becomes paramount.
    4.  **Data Liveness:** Ensuring that the off-chain data is accessible and that proofs are generated and submitted promptly becomes critical. If proofs are not timely, the on-chain system might halt or become unusable.

*   **Reduced Trust Assumptions (in some ways) / New Trust Assumptions (in others):**
    *   **Reduced Trust:** You trust the ZK proof and the on-chain verifier contract less about *what happened* off-chain (as the proof verifies that).
    *   **New Trust:** You now need to trust the mechanism that ensures the **availability and integrity of the off-chain data** and the **correctness of the ZK proof generation process**. This might involve trusting the rollup operator, a data availability layer, or a specific data replication strategy.

**How Blockchains Mitigate These New Threats:**

To address these shifted threat models, systems employing off-chain data use various mechanisms:

*   **Data Availability Layers (e.g., Celestia, Ethereum DA):** These are separate blockchains or protocols specifically designed to ensure data availability. Data is posted to these layers with strong availability guarantees, often using erasure coding or ZK proofs themselves.
*   **Fraud Proofs and Data Availability Proofs:** Some systems combine ZK proofs (for validity) with fraud proofs (for data availability challenges). If data is missing, users can submit a fraud proof, and the system can penalize the party responsible for data availability.
*   **Data Replication:** Encouraging or mandating multiple entities to store copies of the off-chain data.
*   **Economic Incentives:** Designing economic mechanisms where operators are incentivized to keep data available and generate proofs correctly, and are penalized (slashed) if they fail.

**In essence, moving data off-chain is a trade-off:** You gain scalability, lower fees, and potentially faster transaction finality, but you introduce new trust assumptions and potential failure modes related to the availability and integrity of that off-chain data. The security of the entire system then relies on the robustness of the off-chain data management and verification mechanisms.
