    **NOTE:** This is an example threat model created based on specific instructions and conversation context.

    This document outlines potential threats to the Solana blockchain platform. Solana is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain utilizing a unique Proof-of-History (PoH) timing mechanism combined with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus (Tower BFT) to achieve high throughput and low transaction fees. It uses the Sealevel runtime for parallel smart contract execution (primarily in Rust, C, C++).

    This threat model focuses on the core protocol, consensus mechanisms, state management (including the rent mechanism), validator operations, and network bootstrapping (snapshotting), considering potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

analysis: |
  Solana's design prioritizes high throughput and low fees, achieved through innovations like Proof-of-History and parallel transaction processing (Sealevel). This focus introduces specific threat vectors related to the complexity of these mechanisms, the high hardware requirements for validators (potentially impacting decentralization), reliance on snapshots for synchronization, and the unique aspects of its state management, particularly the rent mechanism. Common blockchain threats like consensus attacks and DoS are also relevant, adapted to Solana's PoS/PoH context. This threat model explores these areas to identify potential weaknesses and corresponding mitigations.

threats:
  - ID: CONSENSUS_TAKEOVER_51_PERCENT
    title: Consensus Takeover (51% Stake Attack)
    attack: |
      An attacker (or colluding group) acquires sufficient stake (typically >33% for liveness attacks, >51% for safety/reorg attacks in PoS) to manipulate consensus, potentially censoring transactions, double-spending (via state manipulation/reorgs), or halting the chain.
    threatType: Tampering, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege
    impactDesc: |
      Loss of network finality, potential for double spends, transaction censorship, and complete network halt, severely undermining trust and usability.

    threatType: Tampering, Information Disclosure

  - ID: RENT_INDUCED_DATA_LOSS
    title: Accidental Account Deletion via Rent Mechanism
    attack: |
      A user or application unintentionally allows an account's SOL balance to fall below the rent-exempt minimum. After a period, the Solana runtime garbage collects the account, deleting its state (e.g., token balance, NFT data, application state).
    threatType: Data Loss (Availability/Integrity aspect)

  - ID: RENT_EXPLOITATION_AMPLIFICATION
    title: Rent Mechanism Amplifying Exploit Impact
    attack: |
      An attacker exploits an unrelated vulnerability (e.g., smart contract bug, private key compromise) to drain SOL from target accounts. The rent mechanism then causes these accounts (and their associated state/assets) to be permanently deleted when they become non-rent-exempt, amplifying the damage beyond just the SOL loss.
