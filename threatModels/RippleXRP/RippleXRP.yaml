  description: |
    This threat model focuses on the Ripple/XRP ecosystem, 
    specifically examining the security properties and potential threats related to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) technology, 
    the XRP digital asset, and the interactions between key participants including users, validators, and Ripple (the company).
     It considers the unique aspects of the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol (RPCA) based on Unique Node Lists (UNLs) and the implications for decentralization, 
     censorship resistance, and ledger integrity. The model distinguishes between Ripple the company, the open-source XRPL, and the XRP asset.

      description: |
        Ripple (the company) retains significant influence over the core codebase development and historically shaped the default UNL, impacting perceived decentralization.

analysis: |
  The XRP Ledger presents a unique set of trade-offs compared to traditional PoW or PoS blockchains. 
  Its Federated Byzantine Agreement (RPCA) consensus mechanism enables high speed, low cost, and scalability, 
  making it suitable for payments. However, this design relies on trusted validator lists (UNLs), introducing potential 
  centralization vectors and weaker censorship resistance compared to more decentralized networks. Ripple's significant XRP holdings and historical 
  influence over development and the default UNL are key factors in the threat landscape, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest,
   market manipulation, and the practical level of decentralization. Mitigations rely heavily on validator diversity, independent UNL curation 
   (e.g., by XRPLF), transparent processes, and economic incentives aligning validators with network health.

threats:
  - ID: RIPPLE_CENTRALIZATION_RISK
    title: Excessive Influence by Ripple Company
    attack: |
      Ripple leverages its large XRP holdings (including escrow), primary role in core `rippled` development, and historical influence over the default UNL to potentially steer network direction, prioritize features beneficial to its business, influence consensus outcomes indirectly, or exert undue market influence through XRP sales.
    threatType: Manipulation / Elevation of Privilege (Influence)
    impactDesc: |
      Erosion of network decentralization, potential for governance decisions favoring Ripple's interests over the broader community, increased risk of perceived or actual conflicts of interest, potential for market instability due to large XRP sales, and a potential single point of pressure for regulatory actions.
