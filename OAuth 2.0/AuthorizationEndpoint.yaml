      A hostile party could take advantage of this
      by intercepting the client's requests and returning misleading or
      otherwise incorrect responses.  This could be achieved using DNS or
      Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing.  Wide deployment of OAuth
      and similar protocols may cause users to become inured to the
      practice of being redirected to web sites where they are asked to
      enter their passwords.  If users are not careful to verify the
      authenticity of these web sites before entering their credentials, it
      will be possible for attackers to exploit this practice to steal
      users' passwords.

          Authorization servers should consider such attacks when developing
          services based on OAuth and should require the use of transport-
          layer security for any requests where the authenticity of the
          authorization server or of request responses is an issue (see
          Section 5.1.2).

    attack: |
      When obtaining end-user authorization, the end user may not
      understand the scope of the access being granted and to whom, or they
      may end up providing a client with access to resources that should
      not be permitted.

        description: |
          Narrow the scope, based on the client.  When obtaining end-user
          authorization and where the client requests scope, the
          authorization server may want to consider whether to honor that
          scope based on the client identifier.  That decision is between
          the client and authorization server and is outside the scope of
          this spec.  The authorization server may also want to consider
          what scope to grant based on the client type, e.g., providing
          lower scope to public clients (Section 5.1.5.1).
